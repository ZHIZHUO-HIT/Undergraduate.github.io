## Introduce

Designed a robotic ship with functions such as automatic driving and garbage classification. The ship has two modes of operation: manual remote control, follow the predetermined track. It is shown in the following video(I am so sorry this video was made a long time ago, the material can no longer be edited again. Because the original video was made with Chinese commentary and subtitles,  I add some key English commentary, it looks a little cluttered )ï¼š

## Project source

Funded by Shandong University Undergraduate Research Training Program $1200 

## Mainly responsible

- Designed an autopilot with MCU Mega2560 and some sensors, including the gyroscope, accelerometer,
  magnetometer and GPS. The autopilot was docked to ground station Mission planner to realize the automatic driving of the ship. Its design referenced APM and has been improved.
- Designed the obstacle avoidance module with ultrasonic wave and laser which achieved the recognition rate>95%. As well designed the drive circuit of ship propeller, achieved >500W peak power. 

## Achievement

Won First Prize of Electronic Information Technology Application Competition in Shandong,   Second Prize of National Mechanical Innovation Design Competition (
Shandong Division) and Second Prize of National College Students Entrepreneurship Competition(Shandong Division). The certificates are shown below:
