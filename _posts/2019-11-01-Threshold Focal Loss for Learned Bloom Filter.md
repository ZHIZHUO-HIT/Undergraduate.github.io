## Project source

Funded by Shandong University Undergraduate Research Training Program $1200 

## Mainly responsible

- Designed an autopilot with MCU Mega2560 and some sensors, including the gyroscope, accelerometer,
  magnetometer and GPS. The autopilot was docked to ground station Mission planner to realize the automatic driving of the ship. Its design referenced APM and has been improved.
- Designed the obstacle avoidance module with ultrasonic wave and laser which achieved the recognition rate>95%. As well designed the drive circuit of ship propeller, achieved >500W peak power. 

## Achievement

Won Second Prize of National Mechanical Innovation Design Competition and Second Prize of National
College Students Entrepreneurship Competition.
