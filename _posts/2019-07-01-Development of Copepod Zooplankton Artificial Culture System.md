Explain the serial number in the figure：A water storage tank (1) for storing seawater and a water supply pipeline (15) connected to the water storage tank (1), the water supply pipeline (15) and at least one incubator (6) for cultivating copepod zooplankton Connected, the incubator (6) is provided with a bait box (5) for storing and feeding bait, and the incubator (6) is further provided with a collection line (3) for collecting eggs and larvae, The incubator (6) is connected to the water storage tank (1) through the return water pipeline (7). The water storage tank (1) is provided with a water inlet pipeline (11) and a drain pipeline (13). The water storage tank (1) There is also an acidifier (12) and a temperature sensor (14), the above-mentioned water supply pipeline (15), collection pipeline (3), return water pipeline (7), water inlet pipeline (11) and drainage The pipeline (13) is provided with a valve (3), and the culture device further includes an acidifier (9), a temperature sensor (14) and valves (3) on all pipelines, and is used to control the acidifier (9), Temperature sensor (14) and all valves (3)Control box (10).

## Introduce

Design a set of copepod zooplankton artificial breeding system to realize multi-station incubator in the same water area.

## Project source

Funded by Weihai Science and Technology Research Project $2000 , attended as the undergraduate research assistant project. 

## Mainly responsible

- Designed a desktop terminal for real-time monitoring of copepod zooplankton artificial cultivation. 
- Used PH sensor, water oxygen content sensor, mechanical arm motion sensor to build the sensor net, used NRF for wireless communication and built the terminal with LCD, keyboard etc. 

## Achievement

Awarded Shandong University Outstanding Undergraduate Research Assistant . The letter of appointment is as follows：
