## Introduce

The mission of this system was to control the position of the ball on the board (make the ball stand still at any point or make the ball move along a certain trajectory).Used OV7725 camera to get the location of the ball. Proposed a cascade PID algorithm (including angular velocity loop, angular acceleration loop, ball speed loop and the angle loop) to control two servos to move the position of the ball on the plate. The operation of the entire system can be demonstrated by the following video.

## Summary

Won First Prize of National College Students Electronic Design Competition sponsored by TI. This contest only allows three days from the announcement of the title to the submission of works, but we have used more than a year to reserve relevant knowledge and skills. During the three days of the competition, my two teammates and I did not sleep, and the test was completed and submitted only two hours before the deadline. The certificate is as follows:
